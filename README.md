Image Convolution and Edge Detection Using Sobel Operator
Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform image convolution and edge detection using the Sobel operator. The Sobel operator is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function.

Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Conclusion
This project showcases how to use the Sobel operator for edge detection in images. The Sobel operator effectively highlights the edges by computing the gradient magnitude.
